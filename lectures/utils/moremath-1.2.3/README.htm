<H2>Description</H2>

<P>This README comes with MoreMath v1.2.1a (2001/09/07).</P>

<P>Bundle <code>moremath</code> consists of several packages extending LaTeX2e
capabilities in following major areas: vector typesetting, bold greek
letters availability, numbers/units formatting, better linebreaks at binary
operators/relations, Dirac bra and ket notation. Moreover it includes
Slanted Sans Serif Bold Extended Computer Modern font intended for vector
typesetting. Some parts of the bundle work in Plain TeX too.</P>

<H2>Installation</H2>

<P>I have tried to automate the installation process for following TeX
systems: UNIX systems <A HREF="#TDS">conforming TDS</A>
(TeX Directory Standard);
<A HREF="#CS-TeX">DOS CS-TeX</A>. The latter is supproted mostly for
sentimental reasons and I can no longer check the automated installation
really works. If your system is not listed above or the automated
installation fails you have to install it <A HREF="#namual">manually</A>.</P>

<p>If your TeX system is TDS conforming
(e.g. some M$-Windows installations) and
you have the make utility, you can also try to edit <code>Makefile</code> and
convert commands like <code>mkdir</code> and
<code>install</code> and shell constructions to your-OS equivalents (or get
your-OS ports of <code>sh</code> and these commands; for M$-Windows use the
<a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/">Cygwin</a> tools).</P>

<A NAME="TDS"></A>
<H3>TDS conforming systems</H3>

<P>Edit the <code>Makefile</code> and change BASEDIR value to root
TeX directory to which
you want to install moremath. Then run <code>make all</code>.
If you want documentation
(recommended ;-) run <code>make doc</code>. Then run <code>make
install</code> (it installs documentation too---if any is
generated---to <code>$(BASEDIR)/doc/latex/trific/</code>).
Command <code>make clean</code> does what you expect.</P>

<A NAME="CS-TeX"></A>
<H3>DOS CS-TeX</H3>
<P>Enter TeX menu system (not needed, if you have all TeX-specific
environment variables set globally). Then run <code>make.bat all</code>.
If you want documentation (recommended ;-) run <code>make.bat doc</code>.
Then run <code>make.bat install</code> (it installs documentation too---if
any is generated---to <code>%EMTEXDIR%\doc\trific</code>).
Command <code>make.bat clean</code> does what you expect.</P>

<A NAME="manual"></A>
<H3>Manual installation</H3>

<P>Following description is quite `generic' (i.e. not very concrete).
On other hand it should work on almost any TeX installation in the
world---assuming you have enough rights.</P>

<P>Run the file <code>moremath.ins</code> through Plain TeX
(can be nontrivial task).
If it compiles succesfully, you'll get following files:
<code>binbreak.sty</code>,
<code>binbreak.tex</code>,
<code>bracketsym.sty</code>
(or <code>bracksym.sty</code> on 8+3 file systems),
<code>mathabbr.sty</code>,
<code>mathabbr.tex</code>,
<code>moremath.sty</code>,
<code>newvec.sty</code>,
<code>valform.sty</code>,
<code>valform.tex</code>,
<code>cmvec10.mf</code>
and <code>ot1cmvec.fd</code>.</P>

<P>Move all <code>.sty</code> and <code>.fd</code> files to some location
searched by (La)TeX for input files. It's recommended to move them to
separate subdirectory called `trific', if it's possible.</P>

<P>Move the file <code>cmvec10.mf</code> to some location searched by
METAFONT for input files.</P>

<P>Maybe you will have to run the file <code>cmvec10.mf</code> through
METAFONT to generate metric (tfm) and bitmap (gf) files, convert the latter
to packed (pk) format and move them
to some standard places for font metrics and bitmaps.
This is usually very nontrivial task, so thank God and your system
administrator, if such things are done automatically when needed on your
system.</P>

<P>Now the important components are successfully installed (hope).
To generate documentation, run the file <code>moremath.dtx</code> through
LaTeX2e. Run it thrice, to get consistent cross references.
If you want index, run MakeIndex on <code>moremath.idx</code>
after the second run (on 8+3 file systems the name of <code>makeindex</code>
will be somehow abbreviated).
Optionally you can run DVI-to-PostScript convertor on resulting
DVI file <code>moremath.dvi</code> to get PostScript version of
documentation.</P>

<P>Copy the documentation and the file <code>COPYING</code> to some
safe/standard place and make sure everything mentioned above is copied where
it belongs. Then you can delete all the generated stuff.</p>

<H2>Compatibility</H2>

<P>The MoreMath bundle is known to work with LaTeX2e 1996/12/01 or newer.
Older versions of LaTeX2e seem to have some font problems.
It definitely doesn't (and never will) work under LaTeX 2.09.</P>

<P>Some parts of the bundle are Plain-TeX-ized, so they work under
Plain TeX.</P>

<P>To compile documentation, you need the amssymb package.</P>
